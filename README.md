Hi!

My name is **Yury Belyakov** and I'm a frontend developer from Russia. I have been doing web development since 2003. During this time I have worked on many major projects for companies such as [Art. Lebedev Studio](http://www.artlebedev.com/), [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company/). Now I'm working at [NetCracker Technology](http://www.netcracker.com/) company.

I love my job and always try to learn something new. My favorite technologies are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. But I'm also interested in all technologies and tools associated with web development. [My resume](Yury_Belyakov_RU.pdf) contains more detailed information about my work experience and skills.

Besides work I love my family, good movies, computer games and online poker.
